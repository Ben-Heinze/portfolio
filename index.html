	<p>
		I'm Ben Heinze, a computer science graduate from Montana State University. Moving around most of my
		early childhood due to my father's military service, my family eventually settled in Helena, Montana in
		2011. I stayed in Helena until I graduated from Capital High School in 2019, then sought a film degree
		from Montana State University Bozeman. After two full years in the program, I decided to switch majors to
		computer science.
	</p>
	<p>
		Graduating from Montana State University in 2024, I'm versed in many sectors of computer science (databases, artificial intelligence, web development). I aim to specialize in software engineering and data analysis. Despite having no professional experience in software engineering, I've worked in a four-month scrum team with the goal of giving a complete application to Bozeman MT's Human Resource Development Council (HRDC). I have a strong background in working well within teams and was the only recipient of the Outstanding Undergraduate Course Assistant, awarded by MSU's computer science director, John Paxton.

					In my free time, I love playing casual soccer with friends and strangers. It's a great way to
					stay active and enjoy some friendly competition, and the adult league in soccer is all that. I find
					that soccer not only helps me stay fit but also sharpens my teamwork and communication skills.
					That, and it's a fun way to unwind and connect with others who share a passion for the game.
